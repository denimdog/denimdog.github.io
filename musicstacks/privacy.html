                    <p>Music Stacks is published by <strong>Denim Dog LLC</strong>, a Kansas limited liability company.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>2. How Music Stacks works with Apple Music</h3>
                    <p>Music Stacks is an <strong>Apple Music client</strong> that runs entirely on your device.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All library reads and writes happen on your device and are sent directly to Apple's servers through the official <strong>MusicKit</strong> framework over encrypted HTTPS.</li>
                        <li>Your Apple Music library data (songs, playlists, listening history) is processed by Music Stacks on your device.</li>
                        <li>Denim Dog LLC does not operate servers that handle your music data.</li>
                    </ul>
